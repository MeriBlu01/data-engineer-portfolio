## Weekly Metrics Report: Testers Performance

### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and implement a data engineering system that extracts, processes, and visualizes key performance metrics of a group of testers who work with tools like Jira, Postman, Bitrise, and TestRail in an agile environment. These metrics include the number of test cases resolved, tasks assigned and completed, bugs found and fixed, and other relevant values to assess the testers' work.

### Project Description

#### 1. Data Collection

1. **Data Sources:**
   - **Jira:** To obtain data on tasks assigned and resolved, and bugs found.
   - **Postman:** For statistics on API test executions.
   - **Bitrise:** For metrics on continuous integrations and deployments.
   - **TestRail:** For data on test cases executed and their status (resolved, failed, in progress).

2. **Extraction Frequency:**
   - Data will be extracted weekly.

3. **Extraction Methods:**
   - **APIs:** Utilize the APIs provided by Jira, Postman, Bitrise, and TestRail to automate data extraction.
   - **Scripting:** Scripts in Python or another suitable language to make API calls and store the data in a database.

#### 2. Data Storage

1. **Database:**
   - Use a relational database (such as PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (such as MongoDB) depending on the volume and nature of the data.
   - Design appropriate schemas to store the data from each tool in a structured manner.

#### 3. Data Processing

1. **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):**
   - **Extraction:** Retrieve data from the APIs.
   - **Transformation:** Clean and normalize the data, such as converting date formats, normalizing field names, etc.
   - **Load:** Store the transformed data in the database.

2. **Process Automation:**
   - Use tools like Apache Airflow or automation scripts to schedule and manage ETL tasks weekly.

#### 4. Analysis and Reporting

1. **Visualization Tools:**
   - Use tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python visualization libraries (such as Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create interactive dashboards.

2. **Metrics to Visualize:**
   - **Test cases resolved:** Number of test cases completed each week.
   - **Tasks assigned and resolved:** Number of tasks assigned and resolved in Jira.
   - **Bugs found and fixed:** Number of bugs identified and fixed.
   - **Postman statistics:** Number of API tests executed, success/failure rates.
   - **Bitrise metrics:** Number of integrations and deployments, build times.

3. **Weekly Reports:**
   - Generate automated reports sent via email to stakeholders, including executive summaries and key visualizations.
   - Real-time dashboards accessible through an internal web portal.

#### 5. Implementation and Maintenance

1. **Development and Implementation:**
   - Development of extraction scripts and ETL pipelines.
   - Database setup and creation of visualization dashboards.
   - Implementation of automation and dashboard deployment.

2. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
   - Continuous monitoring of the ETL process to ensure data integrity.
   - Ongoing updates and improvements to the system based on user feedback and changes in the tools used by testers.

### Project Timeline

1. **Planning Phase (2 weeks):**
   - Define detailed requirements.
   - Design the database schema and select tools.

2. **Development Phase (4 weeks):**
   - Develop scripts for data extraction.
   - Database configuration and ETL pipeline creation.

3. **Implementation Phase (3 weeks):**
   - Develop dashboards and reports.
   - Integrate visualizations with stored data.

4. **Testing Phase (2 weeks):**
   - Test functionality and performance.
   - Adjust and optimize the system.

5. **Deployment and Training (1 week):**
   - Deploy the system to the production environment.
   - Train end users.

6. **Continuous Maintenance:**
   - Post-implementation monitoring and support.
   - Update components as needed.

### Conclusion

This project will provide a comprehensive solution for managing and visualizing key performance metrics of testers, improving transparency and data-driven decision-making in an agile environment. Weekly automation and analysis will enable continuous performance tracking and timely identification of improvement areas.
